MooseNG - Next Generation Distributed File System

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
MooseNG is a clean-room reimplementation of MooseFS in Rust, providing a high-performance, reliable, and modern distributed file system with enhanced features including built-in high availability, container-native deployment options, advanced erasure coding capabilities, and multiregion support for global deployments.

CORE OBJECTIVES:
1. Port MooseFS functionality to Rust for improved memory safety and performance
2. Implement free high availability out of the box (no commercial version needed)
3. Provide native Docker and Kubernetes deployment options
4. Add erasure coding support with 8+n and 4+n configurations
5. Implement multiregion support with active/active/active 3-region deployments
6. Maintain compatibility with existing MooseFS protocols where feasible
7. Improve operational experience with better monitoring and management tools

KEY FEATURES:

1. CORE COMPONENTS (Rust Implementation):
   - Master Server: Metadata management with built-in HA and automatic failover
   - Chunk Server: Data storage with erasure coding support
   - Client: FUSE-based mount with improved caching and performance
   - Metalogger: Enhanced metadata backup with real-time replication

2. HIGH AVAILABILITY:
   - Raft consensus for master server clustering
   - Automatic leader election and failover
   - Multiple active masters for read scaling
   - Zero-downtime upgrades

   - YugabyteDB-style xCluster replication
   - Raft leader leases for fast reads/writes
   - Active/active/active 3-region configuration
   - Geo-distributed consensus with locality awareness
   - Region-aware data placement policies
   - Cross-region async replication with bounded lag
   - Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for metadata
   - Regional failover with RPO/RTO guarantees
   - Hybrid logical clocks for distributed ordering
   - Configurable consistency levels per operation

4. ERASURE CODING:
   - Reed-Solomon erasure coding implementation
   - 8+n configurations for high storage efficiency
   - 4+n configurations for balanced efficiency/performance
   - Automatic migration between replication and erasure coding

   - Service mesh integration
   - Cloud-native storage integration (CSI driver)

6. IMPROVED FEATURES:
   - Async I/O throughout with Tokio
   - Zero-copy data paths where possible
   - Enhanced metadata caching
   - Improved small file performance
   - Native compression support
   - Tiered storage with automatic data movement

7. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE:
   - Prometheus metrics export
   - Grafana dashboards
   - CLI management tools
   - REST API for automation
   - Comprehensive logging with structured output
   - Health checks and self-healing capabilities

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:

1. RUST STACK:
   - Tokio for async runtime
   - Tonic for gRPC communication
   - Sled or RocksDB for metadata storage
   - Reed-Solomon crate for erasure coding
   - FUSE bindings for client mounting

2. NETWORKING:
   - gRPC for inter-component communication
   - Protocol buffers for message serialization
   - TLS encryption for all connections
   - Connection pooling and multiplexing
   - WAN-optimized protocols for cross-region traffic

3. STORAGE:
   - Direct I/O for chunk operations
   - Memory-mapped files for hot data
   - Efficient block allocation
   - Background scrubbing and repair

4. MULTIREGION ARCHITECTURE:
   - Regional master clusters with cross-region consensus
   - Leader leases with configurable timeout
   - Read replicas in each region for low latency
   - Write forwarding to regional leaders
   - Automatic region discovery and topology management

COMPATIBILITY:
- Migration tools from MooseFS to MooseNG
- Optional MooseFS protocol compatibility mode
- Data format conversion utilities

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Feature parity with MooseFS core functionality
2. 2x performance improvement for small files
3. 50% storage efficiency improvement with erasure coding
4. 99.99% availability with HA configuration
5. Sub-second failover times
6. Production-ready Kubernetes deployment
7. <100ms read latency within regions
8. <500ms write latency for cross-region consistency

ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH:

Based on research into leading distributed file systems (Ceph, JuiceFS):

1. METADATA SEPARATION STRATEGY (from JuiceFS):
   - Clear separation of metadata and data storage
   - Pluggable metadata backends (Redis, SQL, key-value stores)
   - Multi-level client-side caching (memory, disk, read-ahead, write-back)
   - Session management for consistency guarantees

2. CONSENSUS AND REPLICATION (from Ceph):
   - CRUSH-like algorithm for deterministic data placement
   - Primary-copy replication pattern
   - BlueStore-inspired direct block management
   - Read balancing across primary PGs
   - MDS-style load balancing for metadata

3. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
   - Focus on client-side caching performance first
   - Implement deterministic placement before complex consensus
   - Build multi-site replication similar to Ceph RGW
   - Use hybrid approaches: consensus for metadata, placement algorithms for data

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
- Clean room implementation (no code copying)
- Test-driven development with continuous benchmarking
- Extensive documentation with architectural decision records
- Performance benchmarking at each milestone (following established patterns)
- Security-first design principles
- Iterative approach: start with single-region, then multi-region
- Focus on operational excellence and observability
