# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create FUSE-based client mount
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the client component that allows mounting MooseNG as a FUSE filesystem.
# Details:
Create a new crate 'mooseng-client'. Use the fuse-rs = '0.7.0' crate for FUSE bindings. Implement basic filesystem operations (read, write, getattr, etc.). Create a gRPC client to communicate with the Master Server. Implement local caching for improved small file performance using lru = '0.10.0' crate.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for individual filesystem operations. Create integration tests that mount a test filesystem and perform various operations. Benchmark small file performance against local filesystem operations.
