# Task ID: 4
# Title: Master Server Core Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core functionality of the Master Server component responsible for metadata management and coordination.
# Details:
Implement the Master Server using Tokio for async runtime. Create gRPC service definitions using Tonic. Implement file system operations (create, read, update, delete, list). Implement chunk allocation and management logic. Create namespace management with proper locking strategy (consider using parking_lot 0.12+ for efficient locks). Implement session tracking for connected clients and chunk servers. Add background tasks for maintenance operations. Implement basic authentication and authorization. Create efficient in-memory representation of the file system tree with Arc<> and RwLock<> for concurrent access. Implement journaling for crash recovery. Add health check endpoints. Implement metrics collection using metrics 0.20+ crate.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual components. Integration tests for file system operations. Benchmark performance under various workloads. Test crash recovery scenarios. Test concurrent access patterns. Simulate network partitions and validate behavior.
