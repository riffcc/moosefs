# Task ID: 18
# Title: Develop CLI management tools
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create command-line tools for managing and monitoring MooseNG clusters.
# Details:
Use the clap = '4.3.0' crate for parsing command-line arguments. Implement a comprehensive CLI structure with modules for cluster, admin, monitor, and config operations. The CLI includes admin capabilities (chunk server management, quotas, storage classes, repair operations), cluster management (status, initialization, scaling, upgrades), monitoring features (real-time metrics, health checks, event logging), and configuration tools (show/set/get operations, storage class management). Built with async operations using tokio and includes placeholder implementations ready to connect to gRPC services. All commands have proper help text, validation, and error handling. Instance 3 (CLI & Benchmarking Specialist) is responsible for implementing the gRPC client integration for the CLI tools, connecting the placeholder implementations to actual gRPC services for real cluster management operations. This instance will also handle CLI architecture documentation, user guide creation, configuration persistence, scripting capabilities, and error handling for gRPC communication. Instance 3 is coordinating this work with Task 32 (unified benchmark suite) as they are responsible for both CLI tools and benchmarking framework integration.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for individual CLI commands. Create integration tests that use the CLI to manage a test cluster. Verify correct handling of various input formats and error conditions. Test each module (admin, cluster, monitor, config) with appropriate test cases. Ensure error handling and validation logic works correctly across all command types. Include tests for gRPC client integration to verify proper communication with backend services. Instance 3 should focus on testing the gRPC client integration aspects of the CLI tools and ensure proper coordination with the benchmarking framework from Task 32.

# Subtasks:
## 19.2. Define work division between instances [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document that Instance 2 handles Raft/multiregion (Tasks 6,8), Instance 3 handles erasure coding/zero-copy (Tasks 7,12), Instance 4 handles metadata caching/CLI (Tasks 13,18)
### Details:


## 20.2. Define work division between instances [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document that Instance 2 handles Raft/multiregion (Tasks 6,8), Instance 3 handles erasure coding/zero-copy (Tasks 7,12), Instance 4 handles metadata caching/CLI (Tasks 13,18)
### Details:


## 18.3. Document CLI architecture [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the CLI architecture, including the module structure and command hierarchy.
### Details:
Instance 3 (CLI & Benchmarking Specialist) will create detailed documentation covering the CLI's modular design, command structure, and interaction patterns with gRPC services. Include diagrams showing the relationship between CLI components and backend services.

## 18.4. Connect CLI to gRPC services [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Instance 3 to integrate the placeholder implementations with the actual gRPC services to enable real cluster management operations in mooseng-cli.
### Details:
As the CLI & Benchmarking Specialist, Instance 3 is currently focused on implementing the gRPC client code to connect CLI commands to backend services. This includes mapping CLI commands to appropriate gRPC calls, handling serialization/deserialization, and ensuring proper authentication and connection management. This work is being coordinated with Task 32 (unified benchmark suite) to ensure consistent integration approaches.

## 18.5. Create user guide for CLI tools [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user-friendly guide documenting all available commands, options, and example usage patterns for the CLI tools.
### Details:
Instance 3 will create comprehensive documentation for end users, including command reference, common usage patterns, troubleshooting tips, and examples for each module (admin, cluster, monitor, config). The guide should be accessible to users with varying levels of expertise.

## 18.6. Implement CLI configuration persistence [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add functionality to save and load CLI configuration settings between sessions.
### Details:
Instance 3 will implement a configuration system that allows users to save preferences, connection details, and frequently used parameters. Include support for configuration profiles and secure storage of sensitive information like credentials.

## 18.7. Add scripting capabilities [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the CLI with the ability to run scripts or command sequences for automation of common tasks.
### Details:
Instance 3 will develop scripting support to allow users to create and execute sequences of CLI commands. Include variables, conditional logic, and error handling in the scripting system to enable complex automation workflows.

## 18.8. Update instance assignment documentation [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update documentation to reflect that Instance 3 is now the CLI & Benchmarking Specialist responsible for CLI gRPC integration and also Task 32 (unified benchmark suite dashboard and database integration).
### Details:
Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new role of Instance 3 as the CLI & Benchmarking Specialist, responsible for both this task and Task 32 (unified benchmark suite dashboard and database integration).

## 18.9. Implement error handling for gRPC communication [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop robust error handling for gRPC client communication, including timeout handling, connection retries, and user-friendly error messages.
### Details:
Instance 3 will implement comprehensive error handling for all gRPC communications, including graceful degradation when services are unavailable, meaningful error messages for users, automatic retry mechanisms with backoff, and logging for troubleshooting purposes.

## 18.10. Coordinate CLI and benchmarking framework integration [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure consistent integration approaches between CLI tools and the unified benchmark suite.
### Details:
Instance 3 will coordinate the development of both the CLI tools and the benchmarking framework to ensure they use consistent approaches for gRPC communication, configuration management, and user interaction. This will include shared libraries where appropriate and consistent command structures for similar operations.
