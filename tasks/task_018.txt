# Task ID: 18
# Title: Develop CLI management tools
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create command-line tools for managing and monitoring MooseNG clusters.
# Details:
Use the clap = '4.3.0' crate for parsing command-line arguments. Implement a comprehensive CLI structure with modules for cluster, admin, monitor, and config operations. The CLI includes admin capabilities (chunk server management, quotas, storage classes, repair operations), cluster management (status, initialization, scaling, upgrades), monitoring features (real-time metrics, health checks, event logging), and configuration tools (show/set/get operations, storage class management). Built with async operations using tokio and includes fully implemented gRPC client integration for all services. The CLI now features comprehensive MasterService integration with all protocol methods, robust error handling with retry logic and failover mechanisms, automatic failover between multiple master servers, connection timeout and retry configuration, real cluster status retrieval with fallback to placeholder data, server registration and heartbeat functionality, and configuration persistence and management. The CLI provides comprehensive cluster management commands, network topology discovery and management, benchmark integration with unified benchmark suite, storage class management, data operations (upload, download, management), and administrative operations with proper authentication. Instance 3 (CLI & Benchmarking Specialist) has successfully implemented the gRPC client integration for the CLI tools, connecting to actual gRPC services for real cluster management operations.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for individual CLI commands. Create integration tests that use the CLI to manage a test cluster. Verify correct handling of various input formats and error conditions. Test each module (admin, cluster, monitor, config) with appropriate test cases. Ensure error handling and validation logic works correctly across all command types. Include tests for gRPC client integration to verify proper communication with backend services. Test the failover mechanisms between multiple master servers and verify the retry logic works as expected. Validate that the CLI correctly handles network topology discovery and management. Ensure the benchmark integration with the unified benchmark suite works properly. Test storage class management and data operations functionality. Verify administrative operations with proper authentication.

## 18.3. Document CLI architecture [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the CLI architecture, including the module structure and command hierarchy.
### Details:
Instance 3 (CLI & Benchmarking Specialist) will create detailed documentation covering the CLI's modular design, command structure, and interaction patterns with gRPC services. Include diagrams showing the relationship between CLI components and backend services.

## 18.4. Connect CLI to gRPC services [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Instance 3 to integrate the placeholder implementations with the actual gRPC services to enable real cluster management operations in mooseng-cli.
### Details:
As the CLI & Benchmarking Specialist, Instance 3 is currently focused on implementing the gRPC client code to connect CLI commands to backend services. This includes mapping CLI commands to appropriate gRPC calls, handling serialization/deserialization, and ensuring proper authentication and connection management. This work is being coordinated with Task 32 (unified benchmark suite) to ensure consistent integration approaches.

## 18.5. Create user guide for CLI tools [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user-friendly guide documenting all available commands, options, and example usage patterns for the CLI tools.
### Details:
Instance 3 will create comprehensive documentation for end users, including command reference, common usage patterns, troubleshooting tips, and examples for each module (admin, cluster, monitor, config). The guide should be accessible to users with varying levels of expertise.

## 18.6. Implement CLI configuration persistence [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add functionality to save and load CLI configuration settings between sessions.
### Details:
Instance 3 has implemented a configuration system that allows users to save preferences, connection details, and frequently used parameters. The system includes support for configuration profiles and secure storage of sensitive information like credentials.

## 18.7. Add scripting capabilities [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the CLI with the ability to run scripts or command sequences for automation of common tasks.
### Details:
Instance 3 will develop scripting support to allow users to create and execute sequences of CLI commands. Include variables, conditional logic, and error handling in the scripting system to enable complex automation workflows.

## 18.8. Update instance assignment documentation [todo]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update documentation to reflect that Instance 3 is now the CLI & Benchmarking Specialist responsible for CLI gRPC integration and also Task 32 (unified benchmark suite dashboard and database integration).
### Details:
Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new role of Instance 3 as the CLI & Benchmarking Specialist, responsible for both this task and Task 32 (unified benchmark suite dashboard and database integration).

## 18.9. Implement error handling for gRPC communication [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop robust error handling for gRPC client communication, including timeout handling, connection retries, and user-friendly error messages.
### Details:
Instance 3 will implement comprehensive error handling for all gRPC communications, including graceful degradation when services are unavailable, meaningful error messages for users, automatic retry mechanisms with backoff, and logging for troubleshooting purposes.

## 18.10. Coordinate CLI and benchmarking framework integration [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure consistent integration approaches between CLI tools and the unified benchmark suite.
### Details:
Instance 3 will coordinate the development of both the CLI tools and the benchmarking framework to ensure they use consistent approaches for gRPC communication, configuration management, and user interaction. This will include shared libraries where appropriate and consistent command structures for similar operations.

## 18.11. Implement network topology discovery and management [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add functionality to discover and manage network topology within MooseNG clusters.
### Details:
Instance 3 has implemented comprehensive network topology discovery and management capabilities in the CLI, allowing administrators to visualize and modify the cluster network structure, optimize data routing, and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

## 18.12. Implement data operations commands [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add commands for data operations including upload, download, and management.
### Details:
Instance 3 has implemented a comprehensive set of data operation commands that allow users to upload, download, and manage data within the MooseNG cluster. These commands include proper authentication, progress reporting, and error handling.
