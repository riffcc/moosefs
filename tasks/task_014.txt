# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement native compression support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add native compression capabilities to MooseNG for improved storage efficiency.
# Details:
Implement multiple compression algorithms (e.g., LZ4, Zstd) using the rust-lz4 = '0.8.2' and zstd = '0.12.3' crates. Develop a mechanism to automatically select the best compression algorithm based on data characteristics. Implement transparent compression/decompression in the data path. Allow per-file and per-directory compression policies.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark compression ratios and performance for various data types. Verify transparent access to compressed data. Test system behavior with mixed compressed and uncompressed data.
