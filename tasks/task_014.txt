# Task ID: 14
# Title: Prometheus Metrics and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive metrics collection and Prometheus integration for all components.
# Details:
Integrate prometheus crate (0.13+) for metrics collection. Implement metrics for all key operations and components. Create HTTP endpoints for Prometheus scraping. Add detailed documentation for available metrics. Implement histograms for latency measurements. Create counters for operation rates. Add gauges for resource utilization. Implement custom collectors for system-specific metrics. Create metric naming convention following Prometheus best practices. Add process metrics (memory, CPU). Implement tracing with OpenTelemetry integration.

# Test Strategy:
Validate metrics collection under various workloads. Test Prometheus scraping functionality. Verify metric naming and documentation. Test alerting based on metrics. Validate tracing functionality. Test metric cardinality and performance impact.
