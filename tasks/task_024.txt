# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement WAN-optimized protocols
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement WAN-optimized protocols for efficient cross-region communication.
# Details:
Implement protocol optimizations for high-latency, low-bandwidth scenarios. Develop a custom congestion control algorithm tailored for WAN links. Implement aggressive compression for WAN traffic. Use the quinn = '0.10.1' crate to implement QUIC protocol for improved performance over unreliable networks.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark protocol performance over simulated WAN links with various characteristics. Compare performance against standard TCP implementations. Test system behavior under poor network conditions (high packet loss, variable latency). Verify data integrity across WAN transfers.
