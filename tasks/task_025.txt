# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement efficient block allocation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an efficient block allocation system for improved storage utilization and performance.
# Details:
Implement multiple block allocation strategies (e.g., best-fit, worst-fit, next-fit). Develop a mechanism to dynamically select the best allocation strategy based on current storage conditions. Implement block coalescing for reduced fragmentation. Use bitmap-based free space tracking for large volumes.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark allocation and deallocation performance. Test fragmentation levels under various workloads. Verify correct handling of out-of-space conditions. Compare storage utilization against other allocation strategies.
