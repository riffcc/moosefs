# Task ID: 25
# Title: Performance Benchmarking and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 9, 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive performance benchmarking and implement optimizations to meet or exceed performance targets.
# Details:
Create benchmark suite for all components and operations. Implement performance regression testing. Add profiling for hot paths. Create optimization for small file operations. Implement memory usage optimization. Add I/O pattern optimization. Create network efficiency improvements. Implement caching strategy optimization. Add compiler and runtime optimizations. Create documentation for performance tuning. Implement comparison benchmarks against MooseFS and other distributed file systems.

# Test Strategy:
Run benchmarks under various workloads and configurations. Compare performance against targets in PRD. Validate optimizations with before/after measurements. Test memory usage under load. Verify I/O patterns match expectations. Test network efficiency with various topologies.
