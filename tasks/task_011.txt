# Task ID: 11
# Title: Docker Container Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker container images and configurations for all MooseNG components.
# Details:
Create Dockerfiles for all components (Master Server, Chunk Server, Client, Metalogger). Implement multi-stage builds for minimal image size. Create docker-compose configuration for development and testing. Implement proper signal handling for graceful shutdown. Add health checks for container orchestration. Create volume management for persistent storage. Implement configuration through environment variables. Add logging configuration for containerized environments. Create container entrypoint scripts with initialization logic. Implement resource limit configurations. Use Alpine Linux or distroless base images for security and size optimization. Add Docker labels for metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Build and test all container images. Validate docker-compose deployment. Test container lifecycle (start, stop, restart). Validate health checks. Test configuration through environment variables. Benchmark performance in containerized environment compared to bare metal.
