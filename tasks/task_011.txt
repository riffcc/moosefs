# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement async I/O with Tokio
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor all components to use asynchronous I/O operations with Tokio.
# Details:
Refactor all blocking I/O operations to use Tokio's async I/O primitives. Implement proper error handling and cancellation for async operations. Use Tokio's runtime for managing async tasks. Optimize thread pool configurations for different components based on their specific workloads.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for async operations. Benchmark performance improvements over synchronous implementations. Test error handling and cancellation scenarios. Verify system stability under high concurrency.
