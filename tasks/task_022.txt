# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement TLS encryption for all connections
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Add TLS encryption to all network connections between MooseNG components.
# Details:
Use the rustls = '0.21.1' crate for TLS implementation. Implement certificate management and rotation. Provide options for mutual TLS authentication. Ensure proper handling of TLS errors and connection upgrades. Implement perfect forward secrecy using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all connections are correctly encrypted using TLS. Test certificate validation and rotation processes. Benchmark performance impact of TLS encryption. Test system behavior with invalid or expired certificates.
