# Task ID: 22
# Title: Tiered Storage Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement tiered storage with automatic data movement between storage tiers.
# Details:
Create storage tier definitions (SSD, HDD, archive). Implement policy-based data placement. Create automatic data movement based on access patterns. Implement background migration tasks. Add tier-aware read path optimization. Create monitoring for tier utilization. Implement cost-based optimization algorithms. Add manual tier control for specific data. Create tier transition hooks for custom processing. Implement efficient tier identification for chunks.

# Test Strategy:
Test automatic data movement between tiers. Validate policy-based placement. Benchmark performance with various tier configurations. Test background migration. Verify tier utilization monitoring. Test manual tier control.
