# Task ID: 7
# Title: Metalogger Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the Metalogger component for enhanced metadata backup with real-time replication.
# Details:
Implement Metalogger using Tokio for async runtime. Create gRPC client for Master Server communication. Implement metadata change log consumption and storage. Create efficient storage format for metadata backups. Implement point-in-time recovery capabilities. Add background tasks for maintenance operations. Implement metrics collection. Create rotation and retention policies for logs. Implement compression for stored logs using zstd or lz4. Add verification of backup integrity. Implement incremental backup capabilities. Create recovery tools for restoring from Metalogger backups.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual components. Integration tests with Master Server. Test recovery from backup under various failure scenarios. Benchmark backup and restore performance. Validate backup integrity after network failures.
