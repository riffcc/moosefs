# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Reed-Solomon erasure coding
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Reed-Solomon erasure coding for improved storage efficiency.
# Details:
Use the reed-solomon-erasure = '4.0.2' crate for erasure coding implementation. Create modules for both 8+n and 4+n configurations. Implement encoding and decoding functions. Develop a chunk placement strategy that considers erasure coding stripes. Implement background processes for converting replicated data to erasure-coded data. Note: Being worked on by Claude Instance 2. Focus on implementing efficient encoding/decoding algorithms and integrating Reed-Solomon erasure coding with the mooseng-chunkserver module.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for encoding and decoding operations. Create integration tests verifying data integrity with simulated chunk server failures. Benchmark storage efficiency improvements and verify 50% improvement over replication.

# Subtasks:
## 7.1. Implement core Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding algorithms [done]

### Details:


## 7.4. Develop chunk placement strategy for erasure coding [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a strategy for placing chunks across servers that accounts for erasure coding stripes.
