# Task ID: 3
# Title: Metadata Storage Backend Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the metadata storage backend using RocksDB or Sled for efficient, persistent storage of file system metadata.
# Details:
Create an abstraction layer for metadata storage with trait interfaces. Implement RocksDB backend using rocksdb 0.20+ crate with appropriate configuration for metadata workloads (LSM tuning, bloom filters, etc.). Implement alternative Sled backend using sled 0.34+ for comparison. Create key design with efficient prefix scanning for directory traversal. Implement batched operations for atomic updates. Add compaction and background maintenance tasks. Implement metadata versioning for point-in-time recovery. Create efficient serialization format for metadata entries. Implement caching layer with LRU policy using lru 0.10+ crate. Add metrics collection for storage operations. Consider implementing a pluggable backend system to support multiple metadata stores (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) similar to JuiceFS approach.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual storage operations. Integration tests with sample filesystem operations. Benchmark different storage backends for read/write performance. Test recovery from corrupted database. Test concurrent access patterns. Simulate various failure scenarios and validate recovery.
