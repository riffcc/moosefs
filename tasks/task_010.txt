# Task ID: 10
# Title: Multi-region Replication Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the framework for multi-region replication with active/active/active configuration.
# Details:
Design and implement cross-region replication architecture inspired by YugabyteDB's approach. Create region-aware Raft consensus with locality configuration. Implement leader leases for fast local reads/writes. Create region-aware data placement policies. Implement cross-region async replication with bounded lag. Integrate Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for metadata using crdts crate. Implement hybrid logical clocks (HLC) for distributed ordering. Create configurable consistency levels per operation. Implement automatic region discovery and topology management. Add metrics for cross-region operations. Create administrative API for multi-region configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with multi-region setup. Test various network partition scenarios. Benchmark cross-region replication performance. Test failover between regions. Validate consistency guarantees under various failure scenarios. Test bounded lag enforcement. Validate conflict resolution with CRDTs.
