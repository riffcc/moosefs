# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Docker containerization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker images for all MooseNG components.
# Details:
Create Dockerfiles for Master Server, Chunk Server, Client, and Metalogger components. Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size. Base images on the official Rust Alpine image. Implement health checks for each component. Create a docker-compose.yml file for easy local deployment and testing.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker images can be built successfully. Test containers individually and in a compose environment. Ensure health checks accurately reflect component status. Verify all components can communicate correctly when deployed as containers.
