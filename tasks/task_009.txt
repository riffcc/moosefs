# Task ID: 9
# Title: Erasure Coding Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Reed-Solomon erasure coding support with configurable data and parity chunks.
# Details:
Integrate reed-solomon-erasure crate (4.0+) for erasure coding. Implement 8+n and 4+n configurations as specified in PRD. Create chunk placement strategy for erasure coded data. Implement encoding and decoding operations. Add background repair for damaged chunks. Create migration between replication and erasure coding. Implement background EC conversion for cold data. Add metrics for erasure coding operations. Implement efficient buffer management for coding operations. Create region-aware stripe placement for multi-region deployments. Optimize for SIMD acceleration where available. Implement progressive recovery to minimize recovery time.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for encoding/decoding operations. Integration tests with Chunk Servers. Test recovery from various failure scenarios. Benchmark performance compared to replication. Test migration between replication and EC. Validate data integrity after recovery operations.
