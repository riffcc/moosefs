# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement multiregion support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop multiregion support with active/active/active 3-region deployment capabilities.
# Details:
Extend the Raft implementation to support multi-region consensus. Implement hybrid logical clocks using the hlc = '0.1.1' crate for distributed ordering. Develop region-aware data placement policies. Implement cross-region async replication with bounded lag. Use CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types) for metadata that can be updated independently in different regions.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for multi-region Raft consensus and CRDT operations. Create integration tests simulating multi-region deployments. Verify RPO/RTO guarantees under various failure scenarios. Test configurable consistency levels for different operations.
