# Task ID: 8
# Title: Raft Consensus Implementation for Master HA
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Raft consensus algorithm for Master Server high availability and automatic failover.
# Details:
Integrate raft-rs crate (0.7+) or implement custom Raft consensus. Create state machine for Master Server metadata. Implement leader election and log replication. Add configuration for cluster membership. Implement snapshot creation and restoration. Create mechanisms for log compaction. Add metrics for Raft operations. Implement leader lease mechanism for optimizing read operations. Create client request routing based on leadership status. Implement split-brain prevention mechanisms. Add network failure detection. Create administrative API for cluster management. Implement non-voting members for read scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for Raft implementation. Integration tests for cluster operations. Test leader election under various network partition scenarios. Benchmark performance impact of consensus. Test snapshot creation and restoration. Validate split-brain prevention. Test automatic failover timing.
