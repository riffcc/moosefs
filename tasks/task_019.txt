# Task ID: 19
# Title: Health Checks and Self-healing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement health checking and self-healing capabilities for all components.
# Details:
Create health check endpoints for all components. Implement internal health monitoring. Create self-healing mechanisms for common failure scenarios. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies. Add automatic restart for failed processes. Create data integrity checking and repair. Implement leader failover for unhealthy masters. Add chunk rebalancing for optimal distribution. Create automatic recovery from metadata corruption. Implement deadlock detection and resolution. Add resource exhaustion handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test health checks under various failure scenarios. Validate self-healing mechanisms. Test circuit breaker functionality. Verify automatic restart capabilities. Test data integrity checking and repair. Validate leader failover. Test chunk rebalancing.
