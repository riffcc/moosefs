# Task ID: 28
# Title: Fix Compilation Errors in Docker Compose Demo for MooseNG
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Troubleshoot and fix compilation errors in the Docker Compose setup for MooseNG to create a working demonstration with 3 masters, 3 chunkservers, and 3 clients using a divide-and-conquer approach.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current Docker Compose setup and identify compilation errors:
   - Review build logs for each service (masters, chunkservers, clients)
   - Categorize errors by component and severity
   - Create a prioritized list of issues to address

2. Apply divide-and-conquer approach:
   - Start by fixing one component type at a time (e.g., master servers first)
   - Create a minimal working configuration with just one instance of each component
   - Scale up to the full configuration once the minimal setup works

3. Address common compilation issues:
   - Dependency version conflicts in Cargo.toml files
   - Missing or incompatible features in crate specifications
   - Platform-specific code that fails in containerized environments
   - Path and permission issues in the Docker environment

4. Fix master server compilation:
   - Ensure Raft consensus library dependencies are correctly specified
   - Verify gRPC service definitions are compatible across components
   - Check configuration for proper network binding in containerized environment

5. Fix chunkserver compilation:
   - Address direct I/O and aligned memory issues that may differ in containers
   - Ensure storage paths are correctly configured for Docker volumes
   - Verify chunk allocation and management code works with container constraints

6. Fix FUSE client compilation:
   - Ensure FUSE dependencies are properly installed in the container
   - Address any kernel version compatibility issues
   - Fix mount point permissions and configurations

7. Update the docker-compose.yml file:
   - Adjust build contexts and Dockerfile paths as needed
   - Update environment variables to reflect fixed configurations
   - Ensure proper volume mappings for persistent storage

8. Implement proper container initialization:
   - Create or modify entrypoint scripts to handle startup sequencing
   - Add health checks to verify component readiness
   - Implement retry logic for inter-component connections

9. Document all fixes:
   - Create a detailed changelog of all modifications
   - Update build instructions in the README
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Incremental testing approach:
   - Test each component type individually before testing the integrated system
   - Verify successful compilation of each component with `docker-compose build <service>`
   - Check container startup with `docker-compose up <service>`

2. Test master server cluster:
   - Verify all 3 master servers start without errors
   - Confirm Raft leader election works properly using logs or API
   - Test failover by stopping the leader and confirming a new one is elected

3. Test chunkserver functionality:
   - Verify all 3 chunkservers start and register with master servers
   - Confirm chunk allocation and storage is working
   - Test data persistence by restarting chunkservers

4. Test FUSE client functionality:
   - Verify all 3 clients can mount the filesystem
   - Test basic file operations (create, read, write, delete)
   - Confirm proper load distribution across chunkservers

5. Integration testing:
   - Run the complete system with `docker-compose up`
   - Create a test script that performs file operations from each client
   - Verify data consistency across clients
   - Test system resilience by stopping and starting various components

6. Performance validation:
   - Run basic benchmarks to ensure reasonable performance
   - Compare performance metrics with pre-fix baseline if available

7. Documentation verification:
   - Follow the updated build instructions to verify they work
   - Test the troubleshooting steps to confirm they resolve common issues

8. Create a demonstration script:
   - Develop a shell script that showcases the working system
   - Include commands to verify the health and functionality of all components
