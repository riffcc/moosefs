# Task ID: 13
# Title: Enhance metadata caching
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced metadata caching mechanisms for improved performance.
# Details:
Implement a multi-level cache for metadata using the moka = '0.9.6' crate in the mooseng-client module. The implementation includes:

- LRU eviction policy with hot entry tracking
- Cache warming and prefetching capabilities via channels
- Distributed cache invalidation via pub/sub
- Advanced statistics and performance monitoring
- Configurable cache settings with validation
- Background maintenance tasks for cleanup
- Performance metrics and recommendations
- Prometheus metrics integration for cache hits, misses, operation durations, and health monitoring

Two new modules have been created: cache_enhanced.rs and cache_config.rs.

Note: Core implementation was completed by Claude Instance 2-C (Tab 4) alongside Task 18. Instance 3 is now working on completing the comprehensive tests and documentation for these modules. Infrastructure & Tooling Specialist (Instance 4) has completed comprehensive unit tests for both cache_enhanced.rs and cache_config.rs modules, including tests for LRU eviction, cache invalidation, expiration, statistics tracking, prefetch requests, cache clearing, configuration validation, metrics calculation, and serialization. The enhanced metadata caching system has been integrated with existing metadata operations and includes a MetadataCacheMetricsCollector for periodic metrics collection. The system now has comprehensive test coverage and is production-ready. Prometheus metrics integration testing has been completed, verifying that metrics collection works correctly under various conditions including concurrent load.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark metadata operation performance with and without caching. Test cache coherence in distributed scenarios. Verify correctness of cached data under various update scenarios. Specifically test:

1. LRU eviction policy effectiveness
2. Cache warming and prefetching performance impact
3. Distributed cache invalidation reliability
4. Statistics and monitoring accuracy
5. Configuration validation
6. Background maintenance task efficiency
7. Performance metrics accuracy
8. Prometheus metrics integration and accuracy

Tests should cover both unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire caching system. Documentation should include usage examples and configuration guidelines.

Unit tests for both cache_enhanced.rs and cache_config.rs modules have been completed, covering LRU eviction, cache invalidation, expiration, statistics tracking, prefetch requests, cache clearing, configuration validation, metrics calculation, and serialization. Integration testing has been expanded to include verification of Prometheus metrics collection and reporting, with comprehensive test cases in cache_integration.rs that verify metrics collection accuracy, health monitoring integration, and behavior under concurrent load.
