# Task ID: 13
# Title: CSI Driver Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Kubernetes integration.
# Details:
Create CSI driver implementation following the latest CSI spec (1.6+). Implement required gRPC services (Identity, Node, Controller). Create volume provisioning and mounting logic. Implement snapshot and restore capabilities. Add volume expansion support. Create volume metrics reporting. Implement topology awareness for multi-zone deployments. Add support for volume modes (filesystem, block). Create proper error handling and reporting. Implement idempotent operations as required by CSI. Add documentation for CSI driver usage.

# Test Strategy:
Test CSI driver with Kubernetes CSI sanity tests. Validate volume lifecycle operations. Test snapshot and restore functionality. Validate volume metrics reporting. Test concurrent volume operations. Benchmark performance with various workloads.
