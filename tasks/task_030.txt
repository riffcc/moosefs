# Task ID: 30
# Title: Conduct comprehensive performance benchmarking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive benchmarking suite for MooseNG.
# Details:
Develop benchmarking tools using the criterion = '0.4.0' crate and the newly created mooseng-benchmarks crate with modular architecture. The benchmarking suite includes real network benchmarks with actual gRPC connection attempts, multi-region latency testing, network file operations benchmark, and comprehensive network simulation. The framework provides realistic performance testing with both real network calls and intelligent simulation fallbacks, supporting file operations (1KB-100MB), network operations, multi-region testing, and concurrent testing with statistical analysis capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Verify benchmark results meet or exceed specified performance criteria. Ensure reproducibility of benchmark results. Compare benchmark results across different hardware configurations. Analyze benchmark results to identify performance bottlenecks. Validate both real network and simulation modes provide consistent results. Test cross-region latency measurements against expected values (70-180ms).
