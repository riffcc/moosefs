# Task ID: 30
# Title: Conduct comprehensive performance benchmarking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive benchmarking suite for MooseNG.
# Details:
Develop benchmarking tools using the criterion = '0.4.0' crate. Implement benchmarks for various operations (e.g., small file performance, large file throughput, metadata operations). Create benchmarks for multi-region scenarios. Implement comparison benchmarks against other distributed file systems. Develop automated benchmarking as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Verify benchmark results meet or exceed specified performance criteria. Ensure reproducibility of benchmark results. Compare benchmark results across different hardware configurations. Analyze benchmark results to identify performance bottlenecks.
