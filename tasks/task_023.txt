# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement connection pooling and multiplexing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop connection pooling and multiplexing capabilities for improved network efficiency and WAN-optimized protocols.
# Details:
The connection pooling and multiplexing infrastructure has been significantly enhanced with the following components:

1. Enhanced gRPC Protocol System with performance optimizations, zero-copy features, conditional compilation, and reflection support
2. High-Performance Connection Pool with health monitoring, automatic cleanup, and adaptive behavior
3. Network Compression utilities supporting gzip with extensible framework for lz4/zstd
4. Intelligent Batching system for improved throughput with configurable size, timeout, and byte limits
5. Connection Health Monitoring for automatic detection and cleanup of unhealthy/expired connections
6. Optimized gRPC Services with full MasterService implementation including instrumentation, error handling, and streaming support

This infrastructure now supports high-performance requirements for multiregion communication.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance improvements from the enhanced connection pooling and multiplexing. Test system behavior under high concurrency with focus on WAN scenarios. Verify correct handling of connection errors, pool exhaustion, and health monitoring. Test connection reuse patterns under various load scenarios. Evaluate compression efficiency and batching performance. Measure latency improvements in multiregion deployments.
