# Task ID: 15
# Title: Develop tiered storage capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement tiered storage with automatic data movement between tiers.
# Details:
Define multiple storage tiers (e.g., SSD, HDD, Object Storage). Implement automatic data classification based on access patterns. Develop a background process for moving data between tiers. Integrate with erasure coding to optimize for different tiers. Use the object_store = '0.5.4' crate for supporting object storage backends.

# Test Strategy:
Verify correct data placement based on classification rules. Test data integrity during and after tier transitions. Benchmark performance improvements from tiered storage. Simulate long-term data access patterns and verify optimal data placement.
