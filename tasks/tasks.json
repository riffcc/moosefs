Include developer-specific information:\n   - How to modify and rebuild components\n   - Development workflow with the Docker environment\n   - Testing strategies for changes\n   - Code structure and important files\n\n9. Create additional documentation files:\n   - ARCHITECTURE.md: In-depth technical details\n   - CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines for contributors\n   - CHANGELOG.md: Version history and changes\n\n10. Format and organize documentation:\n    - Use consistent Markdown formatting\n    - Include a table of contents\n    - Add appropriate headings and subheadings\n    - Include code blocks with syntax highlighting for commands",
      "testStrategy": "1. Documentation completeness verification:\n   - Review the README.md against a checklist of required sections\n   - Ensure all components (masters, chunkservers, clients) are thoroughly documented\n   - Verify all helper scripts are documented with examples\n   - Check that all configuration options are explained\n\n2. Technical accuracy testing:\n   - Have a technical reviewer follow the documentation to set up the system from scratch\n   - Verify all commands and procedures work as documented\n   - Test each helper script to ensure it functions as described\n   - Confirm that the architecture diagrams accurately represent the actual system\n\n3. User experience testing:\n   - Have developers unfamiliar with the system follow the documentation\n   - Collect feedback on clarity, completeness, and usability\n   - Identify any confusing sections or missing information\n   - Time how long it takes to get the system running using only the documentation\n\n4. Troubleshooting verification:\n   - Intentionally create common error scenarios\n   - Verify the troubleshooting guide addresses these issues\n   - Test recovery procedures to ensure they work as documented\n\n5. Documentation rendering check:\n   - Verify Markdown renders correctly on GitHub\n   - Ensure diagrams display properly\n   - Check that code blocks have proper syntax highlighting\n   - Confirm links between documentation files work correctly\n\n6. Cross-reference with code:\n   - Verify documentation accurately reflects the current code\n   - Ensure configuration options match what's available in the code\n   - Check that architectural descriptions match implementation\n\n7. Accessibility and findability:\n   - Test navigation through the documentation\n   - Verify the table of contents links work\n   - Ensure important information is easy to find\n   - Check that search terms yield relevant results\n\n8. Documentation maintenance plan:\n   - Create a process for keeping documentation updated with code changes\n   - Establish ownership for documentation maintenance\n   - Set up periodic review schedule for documentation accuracy",
