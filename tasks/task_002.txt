# Task ID: 2
# Title: Core Data Structures and Protocol Definitions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the core data structures, protocol buffers, and interfaces that will be used across all components of MooseNG.
# Details:
Create a shared library crate for common data structures. Define Protocol Buffers (using prost 0.11+ and tonic) for all inter-component communication. Implement core data structures for file metadata, chunk information, and system configuration. Define trait interfaces for storage backends, networking components, and consensus modules. Create serialization/deserialization implementations using serde 1.0+. Define error types and result wrappers. Implement version compatibility checking for protocol messages. Consider using capnproto as an alternative to protobuf for better performance. Define FUSE interface structures based on fuser crate (0.12+) for client implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all data structures with serialization/deserialization roundtrip tests. Property-based testing using proptest for complex data structures. Compatibility tests with sample MooseFS protocol messages if maintaining compatibility. Benchmark serialization/deserialization performance.
