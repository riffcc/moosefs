# Task ID: 27
# Title: Refactor MooseNG Demo Scripts for Code Organization and Reusability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the MooseNG demo scripts to use shared library functions, improve code organization, and enhance maintainability across the Docker Compose demo environment.
# Details:
1. Create a shared library structure:
   - Establish a `lib` directory within the demo scripts folder
   - Implement modular functions for common operations:
     - Container initialization and configuration
     - Health checking and status reporting
     - Network configuration and validation
     - Volume mounting and data persistence
     - Error handling and logging

2. Refactor existing demo scripts:
   - Extract duplicated code into shared functions
   - Standardize script interfaces and parameter handling
   - Implement consistent error handling and logging
   - Add proper documentation for each function
   - Create helper utilities for common tasks

3. Improve organization:
   - Separate scripts by component type (master, chunk, client)
   - Create a consistent naming convention
   - Implement configuration management through environment variables
   - Add script versioning and change tracking

4. Enhance usability:
   - Create a unified entry point script with command-line arguments
   - Add progress reporting and visual feedback
   - Implement graceful startup/shutdown sequences
   - Add detailed help documentation
   - Create quick-start examples

5. Optimize for maintainability:
   - Add comprehensive inline comments
   - Create a README with usage examples
   - Implement consistent coding style
   - Add validation checks for prerequisites
   - Create troubleshooting guides

6. Performance improvements:
   - Optimize startup sequences
   - Implement parallel operations where possible
   - Add caching for repetitive operations
   - Reduce unnecessary container restarts

7. Testing enhancements:
   - Add self-test capabilities
   - Create validation scripts for demo environment
   - Implement automated verification of component interactions

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional testing:
   - Execute each refactored script to verify it performs the same functionality as the original
   - Test all shared library functions individually with various inputs
   - Verify that all demo scenarios continue to work as expected
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. Integration testing:
   - Run the complete Docker Compose setup using refactored scripts
   - Verify all components start correctly and in the proper sequence
   - Confirm that the system reaches a healthy state
   - Test communication between all components
   - Verify data persistence across container restarts

3. Performance testing:
   - Compare startup time before and after refactoring
   - Measure resource usage (CPU, memory) during operation
   - Test script execution time for common operations

4. Code quality verification:
   - Run static analysis tools on the refactored scripts
   - Verify consistent coding style and practices
   - Check for proper error handling in all functions
   - Ensure all functions have appropriate documentation

5. Usability testing:
   - Have team members follow the new documentation to set up the demo
   - Collect feedback on script usability and clarity
   - Test help documentation and examples for completeness

6. Regression testing:
   - Create a test suite that verifies all original functionality
   - Run automated tests to ensure no functionality was lost
   - Verify that all demo scenarios documented for the original scripts still work
