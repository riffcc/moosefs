# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement automatic region discovery and topology management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop mechanisms for automatic discovery of regions and management of cluster topology.
# Details:
Implement a gossip protocol using the plumtree = '0.0.1' crate for efficient topology information dissemination. Develop automatic region detection based on network characteristics. Implement dynamic topology updates without system downtime. Develop visualization tools for cluster topology.

# Test Strategy:
Test automatic discovery of new regions and nodes. Verify correct topology updates under various network conditions. Test system behavior during topology changes. Verify visualization accuracy of complex topologies.
