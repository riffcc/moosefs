# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create Grafana dashboards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop Grafana dashboards for visualizing MooseNG metrics and system health, building upon the completed Prometheus metrics implementation.
# Details:
Design and implement Grafana dashboards for different aspects of MooseNG (e.g., overall system health, performance metrics, storage utilization). Use Grafana's JSON model to define dashboards programmatically. Implement alerting rules for critical metrics. Create dashboard templates that can be easily customized for different deployments. This task will be handled by Instance 4 (Infrastructure Specialist) as part of the monitoring and visualization infrastructure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dashboards correctly display data from Prometheus. Test alerting rules under various conditions. Ensure dashboards are responsive and performant when displaying large amounts of data.
