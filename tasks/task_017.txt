# Description: Develop Grafana dashboards for visualizing MooseNG metrics and system health.
# Details:
Design and implement Grafana dashboards for different aspects of MooseNG (e.g., overall system health, performance metrics, storage utilization). Use Grafana's JSON model to define dashboards programmatically. Implement alerting rules for critical metrics. Create dashboard templates that can be easily customized for different deployments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dashboards correctly display data from Prometheus. Test alerting rules under various conditions. Ensure dashboards are responsive and performant when displaying large amounts of data.
