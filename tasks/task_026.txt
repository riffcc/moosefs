# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement background scrubbing and repair
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop background processes for data scrubbing and automatic repair.
# Details:
Implement periodic background scrubbing of stored data. Develop checksumming mechanisms using the crc32fast = '1.3.2' crate. Implement automatic error detection and correction using erasure coding. Develop prioritization mechanisms for repair operations. Implement throttling to minimize impact on foreground operations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify detection and correction of injected errors. Test system performance impact during scrubbing and repair operations. Verify correct prioritization of repair operations. Test system behavior with large-scale data corruption scenarios.
