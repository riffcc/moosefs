# Task ID: 26
# Title: Create Docker Compose Demo Setup for MooseNG
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive Docker Compose setup demonstrating MooseNG's distributed file system with 3 masters (Raft HA), 3 chunkservers, and 3 FUSE clients, ensuring full functionality and proper health checks.
# Details:
1. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for:
   - 3 Master servers (master1, master2, master3)
   - 3 Chunk servers (chunk1, chunk2, chunk3)
   - 3 FUSE clients (client1, client2, client3)
   - 1 Metalogger

2. Configure networking:
   - Create a custom bridge network for inter-container communication
   - Expose necessary ports for external access (e.g., client mounts)

3. Set up volumes:
   - For each chunk server, create 4 named volumes for storage directories
   - Create volumes for master servers to persist metadata
   - Set up a volume for the metalogger

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Set unique IDs for each component
   - Configure Raft cluster settings for master servers
   - Set storage paths for chunk servers
   - Configure client connection details

5. Implement health checks:
   - For master servers: Check Raft leader election status
   - For chunk servers: Verify storage directories are accessible
   - For clients: Ensure FUSE mount is active
   - For metalogger: Check connection to master servers

6. Create startup scripts:
   - Implement wait-for-it logic to ensure proper startup order
   - Configure Raft cluster formation for master servers

7. Optimize Dockerfiles:
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize image sizes
   - Implement proper signal handling for graceful shutdown

8. Add logging configuration:
   - Set up centralized logging (e.g., using fluentd or vector)
   - Configure log rotation and retention policies

9. Implement resource constraints:
   - Set appropriate CPU and memory limits for each service

10. Create a demo script:
    - Automate the process of starting the cluster
    - Perform basic operations (create, read, write, delete files)
    - Demonstrate failover scenarios (e.g., master node failure)

11. Document the setup:
    - Create a README with instructions for running the demo
    - Include troubleshooting tips and common issues

12. Optimize for performance:
    - Tune Docker storage driver settings
    - Configure appropriate ulimits for file descriptors

13. Implement monitoring:
    - Add Prometheus exporters for each component
    - Create a Grafana dashboard for visualizing system metrics

14. Develop multiple demo configurations:
    - Mock demo: Fully working with placeholder containers
    - Partial demo: With working components
    - Full demo: With all real components

15. Resolve Rust compilation errors:
    - Identify and fix compilation issues blocking real component integration
    - Ensure all components can be properly built and containerized

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker Compose file validity:
   - Run `docker-compose config` to check for syntax errors

2. Build and start the cluster:
   - Execute `docker-compose up --build -d`
   - Ensure all containers start without errors

3. Check container health:
   - Use `docker-compose ps` to verify all containers are in the "Up" state
   - Inspect logs with `docker-compose logs` for any error messages

4. Verify Raft cluster formation:
   - Check master server logs to confirm leader election
   - Use `docker exec` to run Raft status commands on master containers

5. Test chunk server storage:
   - Verify all 4 storage directories are properly mounted and writable
   - Perform disk I/O tests to ensure expected performance

6. Validate FUSE client mounts:
   - Check if FUSE mounts are active in client containers
   - Perform basic file operations (create, read, write, delete) on each client

7. Test failover scenarios:
   - Stop the Raft leader and verify automatic failover
   - Restart a chunk server and ensure proper recovery

8. Perform load testing:
   - Use tools like fio or iozone to generate file system workload
   - Monitor system performance and resource usage under load

9. Check logging and monitoring:
   - Verify centralized logging is capturing events from all components
   - Access Grafana dashboard to ensure metrics are being collected

10. Test network isolation:
    - Attempt unauthorized access between containers to verify network security

11. Validate resource constraints:
    - Use `docker stats` to check CPU and memory usage stays within limits

12. Run demo script:
    - Execute the automated demo script
    - Verify all operations complete successfully

13. Test scaling:
    - Attempt to scale up/down the number of chunk servers
    - Verify the system adapts correctly to the changed configuration

14. Perform cleanup:
    - Run `docker-compose down -v` and ensure all resources are properly removed
    - Restart the cluster and verify it initializes correctly from a clean state

15. Test all demo configurations:
    - Verify the mock demo correctly simulates the system architecture
    - Test the partial demo with available working components
    - Validate the full demo once all components are implemented

16. Verify compilation fixes:
    - Ensure Rust compilation errors are resolved
    - Confirm all real components can be built and integrated into the demo
