# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Raft consensus for Master Server HA
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Raft consensus algorithm for Master Server high availability and automatic failover.
# Details:
Use the raft-rs = '0.7.0' crate to implement Raft consensus in the mooseng-master module. Modify the Master Server to use Raft for all metadata operations. Implement leader election and automatic failover. Ensure all metadata changes go through the Raft log. Implement a mechanism for non-voting members to support read scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for Raft integration. Create integration tests simulating various failure scenarios. Verify automatic failover occurs within the specified sub-second time frame. Test read scaling with multiple active masters.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Leader Election [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the leader election mechanism for the Raft consensus algorithm
### Details:
Implement heartbeat mechanism, randomized election timeouts, and vote request/response handling in the mooseng-master module

Instance 1 is working on implementing Raft leader election mechanism. Development focuses on basic Raft state machine implementation and election timeout handling. This includes state transitions between follower, candidate, and leader roles, as well as proper management of randomized election timeouts to prevent election conflicts.
