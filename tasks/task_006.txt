# Task ID: 6
# Title: FUSE Client Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the FUSE-based client for mounting MooseNG file systems with improved caching and performance.
# Details:
Implement FUSE client using fuser crate (0.12+). Create gRPC client for Master Server communication. Implement file operations (open, read, write, etc.). Create efficient client-side caching with configurable policies. Implement read-ahead and write-behind for improved performance. Add connection pooling for chunk servers. Implement session management and reconnection logic. Create background tasks for cache maintenance. Add metrics collection. Implement proper error handling and reporting. Create multi-level caching (memory, disk) similar to JuiceFS approach. Implement adaptive read-ahead based on access patterns. Use tokio-uring for Linux platforms to leverage io_uring for better I/O performance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual components. Integration tests with mounted file system. Benchmark performance compared to MooseFS. Test recovery from network failures. Test concurrent access patterns. Validate cache coherence under various scenarios.
