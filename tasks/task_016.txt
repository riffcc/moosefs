# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Prometheus metrics export
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add Prometheus metrics export for all MooseNG components.
# Details:
Use the prometheus = '0.13.3' crate to implement metrics collection and export. Define and implement relevant metrics for each component (e.g., operation latencies, error rates, resource usage). Expose a /metrics endpoint in each component for Prometheus scraping. Implement custom collectors for complex metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all defined metrics are correctly exposed and scraped by Prometheus. Test metric accuracy under various load conditions. Ensure metric collection does not significantly impact system performance.
