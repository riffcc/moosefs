# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement zero-copy data paths
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize data paths to use zero-copy operations where possible.
# Details:
Identify opportunities for zero-copy operations in data transfer paths within the mooseng-chunkserver module. Use memory mapping for efficient data access. Implement scatter-gather I/O for improved performance. Utilize kernel bypass techniques like DPDK where appropriate for high-performance scenarios. Note: Being worked on by Claude Instance 2-B (Tab 3) alongside Task 7. Instance 2 is conducting initial analysis of current data flows in the chunkserver module to identify specific optimization opportunities for memory-mapped I/O and scatter-gather operations.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance improvements from zero-copy implementations in the mooseng-chunkserver module. Verify data integrity across zero-copy operations. Test system behavior under various load conditions.
