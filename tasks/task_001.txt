# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Repository Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the MooseNG project repository with proper structure, build system, and CI/CD configuration for a Rust-based distributed file system.
# Details:
Create a new Rust project using Cargo with workspace support for multiple components (master-server, chunk-server, client, metalogger). Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline with Rust toolchain configuration. Configure linting with clippy, formatting with rustfmt, and test coverage reporting. Add appropriate .gitignore, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and LICENSE files. Use Cargo.toml with appropriate dependencies including Tokio 1.28+ for async runtime, Tonic 0.9+ for gRPC, and other core dependencies. Set up feature flags for optional components. Configure development environment with dev-containers for consistent development experience.

# Test Strategy:
Verify build system works with cargo build. Ensure CI pipeline successfully runs on pull requests. Validate workspace structure with cargo check for all components. Test development environment setup instructions on multiple platforms.
