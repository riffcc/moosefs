# Task ID: 5
# Title: Chunk Server Core Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core functionality of the Chunk Server component responsible for storing and retrieving file data chunks.
# Details:
Implement the Chunk Server using Tokio for async runtime. Create gRPC service definitions using Tonic. Implement chunk storage with direct I/O using aligned_utils crate for better performance. Create chunk allocation and management. Implement read/write operations with proper concurrency control. Add background tasks for maintenance operations (garbage collection, scrubbing). Implement chunk verification using xxhash or blake3 for checksums. Create efficient buffer management with minimal copying. Implement disk space management. Add health check endpoints. Implement metrics collection. Use memory-mapped files for hot data access with memmap2 crate. Implement chunk labeling and tagging for policy-based placement.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual components. Integration tests for chunk operations. Benchmark I/O performance under various workloads. Test recovery from corrupted chunks. Test concurrent access patterns. Simulate disk failures and validate behavior.
