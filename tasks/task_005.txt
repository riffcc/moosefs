# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Metalogger functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Metalogger component for enhanced metadata backup with real-time replication.
# Details:
Create a new crate 'metalogger'. Implement real-time metadata replication from the Master Server. Use tokio streams for efficient data transfer. Implement a local storage mechanism for metadata backups using sled. Create a recovery process to restore metadata to the Master Server.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for metadata replication and storage. Create integration tests simulating Master Server failure and metadata recovery. Measure replication latency and ensure it meets performance criteria.
