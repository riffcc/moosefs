# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement comprehensive logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive logging system with structured output and log levels.
# Details:
Use the tracing = '0.1.37' crate for structured logging. Implement appropriate log levels for different types of events. Use span to track request flow across components. Implement log rotation and archiving. Provide options for log output (e.g., stdout, file, syslog) using the tracing-subscriber = '0.3.17' crate.

# Test Strategy:
Verify log messages are correctly formatted and contain all necessary information. Test log rotation and archiving functionality. Ensure logging does not significantly impact system performance. Verify correct propagation of trace context across components.
