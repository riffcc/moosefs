# Task ID: 20
# Title: TLS Encryption Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement TLS encryption for all network communications between components.
# Details:
Integrate rustls crate for TLS implementation. Create certificate management for components. Implement mutual TLS authentication. Add certificate rotation capabilities. Create secure default configurations. Implement TLS session resumption for performance. Add perfect forward secrecy support. Create SNI support for multi-tenant deployments. Implement OCSP stapling for certificate validation. Add TLS metrics and monitoring. Create documentation for security configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test TLS connections between all components. Validate certificate validation. Test certificate rotation. Verify mutual TLS authentication. Test TLS session resumption. Benchmark performance impact of TLS. Validate security against known vulnerabilities.
