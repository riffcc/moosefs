# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement health checks and self-healing
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop health check mechanisms and self-healing capabilities for MooseNG components.
# Details:
Implement health check endpoints for each component using the comprehensive health check framework in mooseng-common/src/health.rs. The framework includes HealthMonitor for managing health checks across components, HealthChecker trait for component-specific implementations, self-healing actions, alert system with severity levels, and health history tracking. Continue development of component-specific health checkers for client and metalogger components, building on the existing implementations for master and chunk servers. Integrate the health monitoring system with monitoring CLI tools.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for individual health checks and self-healing actions. Create integration tests simulating various failure scenarios. Verify system can recover from failures without manual intervention. Test system behavior under cascading failure scenarios. Validate the alert system with different severity levels and rate limiting functionality.
