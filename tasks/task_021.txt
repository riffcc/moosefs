# Task ID: 21
# Title: Compression Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement native compression support for data storage and transfer.
# Details:
Integrate compression libraries (zstd, lz4, snappy) through rust bindings. Implement configurable compression levels. Create automatic algorithm selection based on data characteristics. Add inline compression for network transfers. Implement chunk-level compression for storage. Create compression statistics and monitoring. Add adaptive compression based on CPU/network conditions. Implement transparent decompression for clients. Create migration path for existing uncompressed data.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark compression ratios and performance with various algorithms and data types. Test transparent compression/decompression. Validate compression level configuration. Test adaptive compression functionality. Verify migration of uncompressed data.
