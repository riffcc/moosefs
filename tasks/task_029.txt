# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement MooseFS protocol compatibility mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop an optional compatibility mode for MooseFS protocols.
# Details:
Implement MooseFS wire protocols for backward compatibility. Develop protocol translation layers between MooseFS and native MooseNG protocols. Implement feature detection to handle differences between MooseFS and MooseNG capabilities. Provide configuration options to enable/disable compatibility mode.

# Test Strategy:
Test compatibility with various versions of MooseFS clients. Verify correct handling of MooseFS-specific features. Benchmark performance in compatibility mode vs. native mode. Test system behavior with mixed MooseFS and MooseNG clients.
