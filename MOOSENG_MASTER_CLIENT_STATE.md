   - `MetadataCacheManager`: Centralized cache management

2. **Filesystem Operations**
   - Basic filesystem structure with root directory initialization
   - Path resolution and traversal

   - Required for high availability and automatic failover
   - Blocks multi-master deployment

2. **gRPC Service Implementation**
   - `grpc_services` module exists but implementation incomplete
   - Missing handlers for protocol-defined RPCs:
     - File operations (Create, Open, Close, Delete, Rename)
     - Directory operations
     - Chunk allocation responses
     - Server registration handling

3. **Block Replication Management**
   - `BlockReplicationManager` defined but not integrated
   - Missing replication factor enforcement
   - No automatic re-replication on failure

4. **Topology Discovery**
   - `TopologyDiscoveryManager` defined but not operational
   - Network-aware chunk placement not implemented
   - Rack and datacenter awareness missing

5. **Quota Management**
   - No user/directory quota enforcement
   - Missing space allocation controls

6. **Trash/Recycle Bin**
   - Trash retention policy not implemented
   - No undelete functionality

7. **Access Control**
   - Basic POSIX permissions present
   - Missing ACL support
   - No integration with external auth systems

## Client Implementation Status

### Current Implementation
The Client (`mooseng-client`) provides a FUSE-based filesystem interface with:

#### Core Components
1. **FUSE Filesystem**
   - `MooseFuse`: Main FUSE implementation
   - Basic file operations (lookup, getattr, readdir)
   - File type conversions
   - Async request handling

2. **Master Communication**
   - `MasterClient`: Handles communication with master servers
   - Connection pooling
   - Basic error handling

3. **Caching**
   - Client-side metadata cache
   - Directory listing cache
   - Configurable cache sizes

4. **Configuration**
   - `ClientConfig`: Comprehensive configuration options
   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Config file support

5. **Health Monitoring**
   - Health check endpoints
   - Metrics collection
   - Integration with monitoring stack

### Missing Functionalities in Client

1. **Write Operations**
   - Write/create/mkdir implementations incomplete
   - No chunk writing logic
   - Missing write caching

2. **Advanced FUSE Operations**
   - No symlink support
   - Missing extended attributes
   - No file locking (flock/fcntl)

3. **Data Operations**
   - No actual data reading from chunk servers
   - Missing read-ahead implementation
   - No data caching layer

4. **Multi-Region Support**
   - No region-aware chunk selection
   - Missing cross-region failover
   - No bandwidth optimization

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - No parallel chunk fetching
   - Missing zero-copy optimizations
   - No adaptive prefetching

6. **Recovery and Resilience**
   - No automatic reconnection to master
   - Missing chunk server failover
   - No local recovery cache

3. Complete basic file operations
4. Enable data reading/writing

### Phase 2: Reliability (High)
1. Implement replication management
2. Add automatic failover
3. Complete health monitoring
4. Add recovery mechanisms

### Phase 3: Performance (Medium)
1. Optimize caching layers
2. Implement prefetching
3. Add connection pooling
4. Enable zero-copy paths

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low)

## Conclusion

MooseNG has a solid architectural foundation with well-designed components. The main blockers are:
1. Compilation issues preventing Raft consensus
2. Missing gRPC service implementations
3. Incomplete data path in the client

Once these core issues are resolved, the system can evolve into a production-ready distributed filesystem with advanced features rivaling enterprise solutions.
