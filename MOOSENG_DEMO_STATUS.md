# MooseNG Docker Demo Status

## 📊 Current Status

### Demo Configurations Available:

1. **Mock Demo** ✅ Ready
   - File: `mooseng/docker-compose.mock-demo.yml`
   - Script: `start-mock-demo.sh`
   - Uses placeholder containers to demonstrate architecture
   - All services start and pass health checks

2. **Partial Demo** 🚧 Components Ready
   - File: `mooseng/docker-compose.demo.yml`
   - Has working: ChunkServers, Metalogger, CLI, Monitoring
   - Missing: Masters, Clients

3. **Full Demo** 🔄 Pending Implementation
   - File: `mooseng/docker-compose.yml`
   - Complete configuration
   - Blocked by Rust compilation issues

## 🏗️ Architecture Demonstrated

```
3 Master Servers (Raft HA)
3 ChunkServers (4 storage dirs each = 12 volumes total)
3 Clients (FUSE mounts)
1 Metalogger (backup)
1 CLI (management)
Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the working mock demo
./start-mock-demo.sh

# Access services
- Masters: http://localhost:9421, :9431, :9441
- ChunkServers: http://localhost:9420, :9450, :9460
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Rust Compilation Errors**
   - `mooseng-common`: Duplicate `HealthStatus` import
   - `mooseng-common`: Unpin trait issue in async_runtime
   - Prevents building real Docker images

2. **Missing Implementations**
   - Master server (Task 4)
   - FUSE client (Task 6)
   - Raft consensus (Task 8)

## ✅ What Works

- Mock demo fully functional
- Docker Compose configurations valid
- Network and volume setup correct
- Monitoring stack operational
- Health checks configured

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Fix Rust compilation errors
2. Complete component implementations
3. Build real Docker images
4. Test full distributed setup
5. Create performance benchmarks
