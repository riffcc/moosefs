# MooseNG Development Coordination

## Instance Work Division

### Main Instance (Tab 1)
- **Role**: Overall coordination and integration
- **Focus**: Monitor progress, resolve conflicts, integrate work from other instances
- **Tasks**: 
  - Track overall project progress
  - Coordinate integration of completed work
  - Handle cross-instance dependencies
  - Work on Tasks 5, 11-20 as dependencies are satisfied

### Instance 2 (Tab 2)
- **Focus**: Master Server implementation
- **Primary Tasks**:
  - Task 2: Implement Master Server core functionality
    - All subtasks from 2.1 to 2.7
  - Task 6: Implement Raft consensus for Master Server HA (after Task 2)
    - All subtasks from 6.1 to 6.6
- **Working Directory**: `mooseng/mooseng-master/`

### Instance 3 (Tab 3)
- **Focus**: Chunk Server implementation
- **Primary Tasks**:
  - Task 3: Develop Chunk Server core functionality
    - All subtasks from 3.1 to 3.6
  - Task 7: Implement erasure coding support (after Task 3)
    - All subtasks from 7.1 to 7.5
- **Working Directory**: `mooseng/mooseng-chunkserver/`

### Instance 4 (Tab 4)
- **Focus**: Client/FUSE implementation
- **Primary Tasks**:
  - Task 4: Create FUSE-based Client implementation
    - All subtasks from 4.1 to 4.6
  - Task 10: Implement advanced caching and performance optimizations (after Task 4)
    - All subtasks from 10.1 to 10.6
- **Working Directory**: `mooseng/mooseng-client/`

## Integration Points

1. **Raft + Multiregion**: Instance 2's work on Tasks 6 and 8 are tightly coupled
2. **Erasure Coding + Storage**: Instance 3's Task 7 integrates with chunkserver
3. **Zero-copy + Performance**: Instance 3's Task 12 affects all I/O operations
4. **Metadata Caching**: Instance 4's Task 13 integrates with master server

## Communication Protocol

1. Each instance should update their subtask status in TaskMaster
2. Use this document to track major milestones
3. Flag any blocking dependencies immediately
4. Integration work happens in main instance

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-05-31 - Session 3 - Parallel Execution)

**PARALLEL TASK EXECUTION ACTIVE**

- **Main Instance (Tab 1)**: ðŸŽ¯ Coordination and Integration
  - Monitoring parallel instance progress
  - Managing TaskMaster status updates
  - Handling cross-instance dependencies

- **Instance 2 (Tab 2)**: ðŸš€ Master Server & Raft Consensus
  - **Primary Focus**: mooseng-master/ directory
  - **Active Tasks**: 
    - Task 6: Raft consensus (subtasks 6.2-6.8) - log replication, safety checks, membership changes
    - Task 8: Multiregion support (all 9 subtasks) - pending Task 6 completion
  - **Status**: Working on core Raft implementation components

- **Instance 3 (Tab 3)**: âš¡ Chunk Server & Storage Optimization  
  - **Primary Focus**: mooseng-chunkserver/ directory
  - **Active Tasks**:
    - Task 12: Zero-copy data paths (subtasks 12.2-12.7) - memory mapping, scatter-gather I/O
    - Task 31: gRPC networking enhancements - connection pooling, multiplexing, WAN optimization
  - **Status**: Task 7 (erasure coding) âœ… completed, advancing zero-copy and networking

- **Instance 4 (Tab 4)**: ðŸ§ª Client & Testing Infrastructure
  - **Primary Focus**: mooseng-client/, mooseng-cli/ directories  
  - **Active Tasks**:
    - Task 13: Metadata caching tests (subtasks 13.9-13.14) - unit tests, integration tests, documentation
    - Task 18: CLI development expansion
  - **Status**: Cache modules completed, writing comprehensive tests
