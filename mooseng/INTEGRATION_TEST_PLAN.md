# MooseNG Integration Test Coordination Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the integration testing strategy coordinated across all specialized instances to ensure seamless system operation.

## Test Categories by Instance Responsibility

### 1. Core Infrastructure Tests (Instance 2 - Infrastructure Specialist)
**Focus**: Chunk Server + Health Monitoring integration

**Test Scenarios**:
- Chunk server startup and registration with master
- gRPC communication between components
- Health check endpoint availability and accuracy
- Failure detection and self-healing mechanisms
- Storage operations under various load conditions

**Integration Points**:
- Master-ChunkServer communication
- Health monitoring across all components
- Failure scenarios and recovery

### 2. Performance & Caching Tests (Instance 3 - Performance Specialist)  
**Focus**: Metadata Cache + Prometheus Metrics integration

**Test Scenarios**:
- Metadata cache hit/miss ratios under load
- Cache invalidation across multi-region deployments
- Prometheus metrics accuracy and collection
- Performance regression detection
- Memory usage optimization validation

**Integration Points**:
- Cache consistency across masters
- Metrics pipeline end-to-end
- Performance baseline establishment

### 3. CLI & Benchmarking Tests (Instance 4 - CLI Specialist)
**Focus**: CLI Tools + Unified Benchmark Suite

**Test Scenarios**:
- CLI command execution against live cluster
- Benchmark suite execution and result collection
- Dashboard real-time data visualization
- Administrative operations via CLI
- Block allocation management through CLI

**Integration Points**:
- CLI-to-gRPC service communication
- Benchmark result storage and retrieval
- Real-time dashboard updates

### 4. End-to-End System Tests (Main Coordinator)
**Focus**: Cross-instance integration and system-wide functionality

**Test Scenarios**:
- Complete file system operations (create, read, write, delete)
- Multi-region deployment with cross-region replication
- Block allocation efficiency across storage tiers
- Disaster recovery and failover scenarios
- System upgrade and migration procedures

## Test Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Component Tests (Parallel by Instance)
Each instance focuses on their component-specific tests:
```bash
# Instance 2: Infrastructure tests
cargo test --package mooseng-chunkserver --test integration_tests
cargo test --package mooseng-master --test health_tests

# Instance 3: Performance tests  
cargo test --package mooseng-master --test cache_tests
cargo test --package mooseng-common --test metrics_tests

# Instance 4: CLI tests
cargo test --package mooseng-cli --test cli_integration_tests
cargo test --package mooseng-benchmarks --test benchmark_tests
```

### Phase 2: Cross-Component Integration (Coordinated)
```bash
# Master-ChunkServer integration
./scripts/test_master_chunkserver_integration.sh

# Metrics pipeline integration
./scripts/test_metrics_integration.sh

# CLI system integration
./scripts/test_cli_system_integration.sh
```

### Phase 3: Full System Tests (Main Coordinator)
```bash
# Complete system deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# End-to-end system tests
./scripts/run_full_system_tests.sh

# Performance benchmarking
./run_comprehensive_benchmarks.sh
```

## Integration Test Dependencies

### Required for All Tests
- ‚úÖ Compilation issues resolved (Instant serialization fixed)
- üîÑ gRPC compatibility issues resolved (Instance 2)
- üîÑ Core component functionality stable

### Required for Performance Tests
- üîÑ Metadata cache implementation complete (Instance 3)
- üîÑ Prometheus metrics integration (Instance 3)
- ‚è≥ Block allocation system implementation (All instances)

### Required for CLI Tests

- ‚è≥ Multi-region deployment scripts ready

## Test Data and Environment

### Test Data Sets
- **Small Files**: 1KB - 64KB (metadata-heavy workload)
- **Medium Files**: 1MB - 100MB (balanced workload)  
- **Large Files**: 1GB+ (throughput-focused workload)
- **Multi-region Data**: Cross-region replication scenarios

### Test Environments
- **Local Development**: Single-node Docker setup
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Multi-container integration
- **Staging**: Multi-region cloud deployment simulation
- **Performance**: Dedicated hardware benchmarking

## Coordination Checkpoints

### Weekly Integration Reviews
- **Monday**: Integration test status from each instance
- **Wednesday**: Cross-component integration issues
- **Friday**: System-wide test execution and results

### Integration Blockers Resolution
1. **Compilation Issues**: Main Coordinator (‚úÖ Completed)
2. **gRPC Compatibility**: Instance 2 (üîÑ In Progress)
3. **Performance Baselines**: Instance 3 (üîÑ In Progress)
4. **CLI Integration**: Instance 4 (üîÑ In Progress)
