- **Get Miss Latency**: < 10Œºs (estimated)
- **Concurrent Throughput**: > 100k ops/sec/core (estimated)

### Memory Usage
- **Base Overhead**: ~200 bytes per cache entry
- **Metadata Size**: Configurable, typically 1-4KB per file
- **Total Memory**: Configurable limit with automatic eviction

### Hit Rate Performance
- **Typical Hit Rate**: 70-95% depending on workload
- **Hot Entry Protection**: Prevents thrashing of frequently accessed data
- **Adaptive Eviction**: Learns from access patterns

## Deployment Recommendations

### Production Configuration

```toml
[cache]
ttl_secs = 300              # 5 minutes for balanced freshness/performance
max_size = 100000           # 100k entries (~400MB estimated)
hot_threshold = 5           # Protect frequently accessed entries
enable_lru = true           # Enable intelligent eviction
enable_prefetch = true      # Enable proactive cache warming
enable_invalidation = true  # Enable cluster-wide invalidation
cleanup_interval_secs = 60  # Cleanup every minute
stats_interval_secs = 300   # Report stats every 5 minutes
eviction_percentage = 5     # Evict 5% when full
```

### Monitoring Setup

Essential metrics to monitor:

1. **Cache Hit Rate**: Should be > 70%
2. **Operation Latency**: 95th percentile < 100ms
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor cache size growth
4. **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%
5. **Health Status**: Monitor automated health checks

### Alerting Rules

Critical alerts to implement:

- Cache hit rate < 50% for > 5 minutes
- Operation latency > 1 second for > 2 minutes
- Cache health check failures
- Memory usage > 90% of configured limit
- Error rate > 5% for > 5 minutes

## Security Considerations

### Memory Safety
- **Rust Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows or memory leaks
