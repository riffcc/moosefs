# MooseNG Common Compilation Fixes Report

## Overview
Successfully resolved all Rust compilation errors in the `mooseng-common` crate. The crate now builds successfully with only minor warnings.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Error Variants
**Problem**: `MooseNGError` enum was missing `InvalidParameter` and `Internal` variants that were being used in the code.
**Solution**: Added the missing error variants to `src/error.rs`:
```rust
#[error("Invalid parameter: {0}")]
InvalidParameter(String),

#[error("Internal error: {0}")]
Internal(String),
```

### 2. Future Pinning Issues
**Problem**: `Box<dyn Future>` doesn't automatically implement `Future` without being pinned.
**Solution**: Changed the AsyncTask struct to use `Pin<Box<dyn Future>>` and added `use std::pin::Pin`.

### 3. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `num_cpus` crate was being used but not included in dependencies.
**Solution**: Added `num_cpus = "1.16"` to Cargo.toml.

### 4. Debug Trait for AsyncTask
**Problem**: `#[derive(Debug)]` couldn't be used on AsyncTask because Future doesn't implement Debug.
**Solution**: Manually implemented Debug trait for AsyncTask, displaying "<Future>" for the task field.

### 5. Conflicting Imports
**Problem**: `timeout` function from tokio::time was conflicting with local module name.
**Solution**: Imported as `timeout as tokio_timeout` and updated all usage sites.

### 6. Duplicate Exports
**Problem**: `HealthStatus` was being exported from both `async_runtime` and `health` modules.
**Solution**: Removed duplicate export from the `health` module re-export in lib.rs.

### 7. Moved Value Error
**Problem**: Attempting to access `task.id` after moving `task` into a channel.
**Solution**: Saved the task ID to a local variable before moving the task.

## Remaining Warnings
The following warnings remain but don't affect compilation:
- Unused imports (uuid::Uuid)
- Unused variables (current_concurrency)
- Unused struct fields (local_priority, cross_region_channels, etc.)

These can be addressed later when the corresponding functionality is implemented.

## Build Status
âœ… **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**

The crate now compiles successfully and can be used as a dependency by other crates in the MooseNG project.
